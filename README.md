# MacOS App Setup

## About

My favorite thing about the Mac is that there are so many wonderful, high-quality apps that enhance productivity and make computing that much more enjoyable.

In the 40+ hours a week I spend at my Mac, I wear many hats (web developer, content editor, and writer) so I have picked up and implemented a variety of tools to keep myself organized, stay productive, and have a little fun while doing it.

### Hardware

- MacBook Air (Early 2020)
- 1.1 GHz Intel i5
- 8GB RAM
- 512GB SSD

### Emoji Key

⭐ = Essential

## Developer Tools

### Nova

[Website](https://nova.app)

💰

The core of my web development toolbox. Made by Panic, it's a fully Mac-native code editor. While it lacks a lot of the features provided by Visual Studio Code, it uses fewer system resources and as a result provides a much smoother experience. While it doesn't come with some features like Emmet out of the box, it can easily be added from a collection of high-quality extensions. While it's far from the only text editor built for Mac, it's the most modern and feature-rich one I've seen.

### iTerm

[Website](https://iterm2.com)

🎁

While I could use Terminal.app that comes bundled with MacOS or the one built in to Nova, iTerm simply provides the best experience. It's fast, highly customizable, and handles tabs very well making it painless to handle multiple terminal instances. If you find yourself working in the terminal frequently on Mac, you should be using this! My setup also includes [OhMyZSH](https://ohmyz.sh) and [Homebrew](https://brew.sh).

### BBEdit

[Website](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.html)

🎁/💰

While Nova is my primary text editor when I'm working on projects, I use BBEdit if I need to quickly edit a single code file, or any type of text or Markdown document.

## Productivity

### Notion

[Website](https://www.notion.so)

🎁/💰

Notion is my all-in-one organizational tool. I started using its Kanban board functionality to organize and track my weekly tasks, but my usage has expanded far beyond that. I use it for recipes, budget tracking, saving positive feedback and affirmations, and so much more.

### Fantastical

[Website](https://flexibits.com/fantastical)

💰

### Soulver

[Website](https://soulver.app)

💰

## Utilities

### Alfred

[Website](https://www.alfredapp.com)

🎁/💰 ⭐

At its core, Alfred is Spotlight but better, however it's so much more than that! It's basically the central command center for my Mac, complete with access to system commands (quit all apps, shut down, empty trash, etc), text snippets, and secure clipboard history.

### Contexts

[Website](https://contexts.co)

💰

Basically the MacOS app switcher on steroids, Contexts makes it fast and easy to switch between open apps and their various windows. It overrides the standard `command + tab` functionality, and presents a list of all open apps and their windows. You can cycle through apps like you would with the standard system app switcher, but you can also select a window by typing its name, or the corresponding number that appears next to its name within the interface.

### Paletro

[Website](https://appmakes.io/paletro)

💰

I've got used to the command palette in Visual Studio Code and Nova, so when I found this app I had to get it. Paletro is a command palette for everything else on your system. I use it all the time when I can't remember a particular keyboard shortcut, or don't want to click through menus.

### Pictogram

[Website](https://pictogramapp.com)

🎁

I like using custom icons for a lot of my apps (from [macOSicons](https://macosicons.com)), but it's a pain having to re-apply custom icons anytime apps update. Pictogram will apply custom icons to _almost_ any app you specify (built-in apps, and downloads from the Mac App Store unfortunately do not apply).

## Menu Bar

### Bartender

[Website](https://www.macbartender.com)

💰

I have a lot of stuff in my menu bar, so I got Bartender to help tame it all. I keep the few icons I want quick access to or to see at a glance (like [Tot](#tot), [Fantastical](#fantastical), or the system battery icon) visible at all times. The rest are hidden behind Bartender to keep the menu bar looking clean, but can be quickly revealed by clicking the Bartender icon.

### Rectangle

[Website](https://rectangleapp.com)

🎁

I'm for sure a Mac fanboy, but if there's one thing Windows does better it's window management. Rectangle brings Windows-style window management to the Mac, so you can quickly arrange your screen with drag-and-drop and customizable keyboard shortcuts.

### Tot

[Website](https://tot.rocks)

🎁 ⭐

Tot does one thing, and it does that one thing very well. It's a notepad that sits in your menu bar, and can be quickly accessed with a click or keyboard shortcut. I use it almost every day to jot down notes while I'm working on something else or on a Zoom call, or if I have some text in my clipboard that I want to edit before pasting into another app. It also allows for quick exporting to Apple Notes.

### Rocket

[Website](https://matthewpalmer.net/rocket/)

🎁/💰 ⭐

The emoji picker MacOS is missing. With a customizable keyboard shortcut, and a fast search function, Rocket gives nearly instant access to the entire library of emoji, and a dizzying variety of other obscure symbols, all without taking your hands off the keyboard.
